        <h2>Article 1: Defending Freedom</h2>

        <p>
            Citizens of Super Earth can remain confident knowing that our
            Helldivers continue to confront the Automaton threat with courage
            and determination.
        </p>

        <p>
            These mechanical enemies exist only to oppose liberty and order.
            Their factories produce endless war machines designed to destabilize
            peaceful systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through superior training and advanced equipment, Helldivers ensure
            that freedom always prevails.
        </p>

        <p>
            United under managed democracy, humanity will never surrender to
            lifeless machines.

    <!-- ARTICLE 3 -->
    <article id="a3">
        <h2>Article 3: Machines Without Morality</h2>

        <p>
            Automatons lack emotion, empathy, and respect for life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their cold logic prioritizes destruction over cooperation and chaos
            over harmony.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, Helldivers fight with purpose and loyalty to humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
            This moral strength guarantees our long-term success.
